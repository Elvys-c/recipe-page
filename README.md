## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about how media queries work and how each part of the page behaves according to the screen size.

```css
@media (max-width: 375px) {}
```

### Continued development

In my project, I used the main and header tags inside a div with the class container, and when adapting the project for smaller screens I had to use media queries. I was unsure whether the way I did it is considered a bad development practice.
